# GPU-Programming-CUDA-C
Parallel programs using CUDA C++ for Nvidia GPUs supporting cuda. 

This repo contains following programs that are written using CUDA C++ to run on GPU in parallel

1. Finding row and column sum of a matrix, finding column minimum and row maximum of matrix
2. Single point crossover
3. Evaluation of a given mathematical function
4. Calculation of cosine distance, Manhattan distance and Euclidian Distance between two n-dimensional points considered as vectors
5. Bubble Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Finding the transpose, sum, difference, scalar and vector multiplications of matrix of parallel and randomly initialized with the number between -1.00 to +1.00
